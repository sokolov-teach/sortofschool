			<h1>Position, Displacement and Vectors</h1>
			<p>How can we tell if someone truly understands Physics? Let’s answer
this question with another. How do we determine that a person knows a
language? It is easy; if a person can maintain a dialogue — written or
verbal — and at the same time we understand him, and he understands us,
it means that we speak the same language.</p>
<p>To know Physics is to know its language, to be able to make words out
of letters and meaningful sentences out of words. And if your speech or
text resonates in people’s hearts, it means that you have mastered this
language.</p>
<p>We start learning any language with its basic part — letters. In
order for you to understand what I will be talking about in future
lectures, we need to learn the basic concepts of Physics.</p>
<p>The first Part of this series will be about
<strong>Kinematics</strong>. Kinematics is derived from the Greek word
for <em>“to move”</em>. Kinematics is a branch of Physics. It is not
interested in WHY bodies move and WHAT sets them in motion. This section
of physics only studies HOW they move and the ways that we can describe
their motion.</p>
<p>In kinematics we study the motion of idealized bodies. The first
concept of such a body is a <strong>particle</strong>.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.1"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span>
Point-like particle</h2>
<p>A <strong>particle</strong> or <strong>point-like particle</strong>
is a fundamental concept in physics.</p>
<p>Imagine an airplane. Up close, this is a very complex object. Yet,
when it’s flying high above, it looks like a tiny dot. If it travels 100
kilometers, we don’t distinguish which specific part of the airplane
covers that distance. For our calculations, it just does not matter.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can think of a point-like particle as a tiny dot we
draw on a large object with a marker and we track this dot’s movement
instead of the entire airplane.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>
A <strong>Point-like particle</strong> is an object that is small enough
relative to the distance it travels.
</p>
</div>
<p>In physics, such simplifications are often resorted to. The reason is
that, otherwise, we would never solve any problem. The world around us
is much more complex than the mathematical models into which we try to
put it. Despite this fact, the accuracy of the answers we get by
simplifying the world in this way is quite sufficient to solve the
problems we encounter.</p>
<p>Now you know that if we see the words <strong>“point-like
particle”</strong> in a problem, we imagine something small, the size,
shape, and composition of which we are not interested.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.2"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span>
Trajectory and Total Distance</h2>
<p>Imagine an airplane circling high above, leaving a trail from its
engines. This trail reveals the <strong>trajectory</strong> of a
plane.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>
A <strong>trajectory</strong> is the path that a moving object follows.
</p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>total distance</strong> or <strong>distance
traveled</strong> represents the entire length of this trajectory. Its
value includes the lengths of all its curves and straight sections of
the plane’s journey.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>
<strong>Total distance</strong> or <strong>distance traveled</strong> is
the length of the trajectory.<br> We will denote it as <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.
</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="frame-of-reference" class="level2" data-number="1.3">
<h2 data-number="1.3"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span>
Frame of reference</h2>
<p>A <strong>frame of reference</strong> is used to describe the
position of an object in space. It is defined by three main elements:
the <strong>origin</strong>, <strong>orientation</strong>, and
<strong>scale</strong>.</p>
<p>Imagine a road with milestones. The zero milestone represents the
<strong>origin</strong>. In one direction from the origin lie milestones
that are numbered negatively. In the other direction, they are numbered
positively; this direction is our <strong>orientation</strong>. The
distance between the milestones (it can be measured in kilometers,
miles, etc.), is the <strong>scale</strong>. Together these three
elements represent our <strong>frame of reference</strong>.</p>
<p>The concept of <strong>frame of reference</strong> is similar to a
<strong>one-dimensional axis</strong> in math. It serves the purpose of
a <strong>coordinate system</strong> and provides a way to describe an
object’s position.</p>
<p>This brings me to one of my favorite things in physics: you can
choose ANY point as your origin, ANY direction for orientation and ANY
scale. Why? Because these axes are just mathematical representations of
reality. They help us to describe the movement of objects, but do not
influence it. Some frames of reference make solving the problem easier,
but if we are not concerned with the complexity of calculations, the
final result will be exactly the same, no matter what frame of reference
we choose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apart from the term <strong>frame of reference</strong>, we also have
the <strong>observational frame of reference</strong>. They are a little
bit different. The first one sets the mathematical stage for describing
the motion, and the second one sets the viewpoint from which we observe
the motion. We’ll discuss observational frames later when we talk about
inertial and non-inertial frames.</p>

Position</h2>
<p>Using the road analogy we described earlier, the
<strong>position</strong> of the object is a milestone number that our
car is next to. If we use the <strong>x-axis</strong> to represent our
<strong>frame of reference</strong>, the position of a car is denoted
with the variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="displacement" class="level2" data-number="1.5">
<h2 data-number="1.5"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span>
Displacement</h2>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Displacement</strong> refers to the change in position and is
denoted as: <span class="math display">\[
\Delta x = x - x_0 \tag{1.1} \label{eq:deltax}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> represents the
current position, and <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> the
initial position.</p>
</div>
<p>Positive displacement means movement in the positive direction of our
axis, while negative displacement signifies movement in the opposite
direction.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Delta (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>):</strong>
This triangle symbol literally means <em>“change in”</em>. </br> So,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span> signifies the change in
position. This symbol can be used to describe the change in any value.
For example, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m\)</span> is a change
of mass, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m\)</span> represents a
change in time, etc.</p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>magnitude of displacement</strong> is the absolute value
of displacement and is denoted as <span class="math inline">\(|\Delta
x|\)</span>. It shows how much the object has moved without concern for
direction.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Total Distance</strong> vs. <strong>Displacement</strong>
vs. <strong>Magnitude of Displacement</strong> <br> Let’s say that the
car moved 7 kilometers in the positive direction of the x-axis and then
10 kilometers in the opposite direction. In this case, total distance,
displacement and it’s magnitude will be equal to: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{cases}
d = 17 km \\
\Delta x = -3 km \\
|\Delta x| = 3 km \\
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
