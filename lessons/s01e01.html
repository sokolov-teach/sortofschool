			<h1>Position, Displacement and Vectors</h1>
			<p>How can we tell if someone truly understands Physics? Let’s answer
this question with another. How do we determine that a person knows a
language? It is easy, if a person can maintain a dialog - written or
verbal, and at the same time we understand him, and he understands us,
it means that we speak the same language.</p>
<p>To know Physics is to know its language. To be able to make words out
of letters and meaningful sentences out of words. And if your speech or
text resonates in people’s hearts, it means that you have mastered this
language.</p>
<p>We start learning any language with its basic part - letters. In
order for you to understand what I’ll be talking about in the future
lectures, we need to learn the basic concepts of Physics.</p>
<p>The first Part of this series will be about
<strong>Kinematics</strong>. Kinematics is Greek for <em>“to move”</em>.
Kinematics is a branch of Physics. It is not interested in WHY bodies
move and WHAT sets them in motion. This section of physics only studies
HOW they move and the ways that we can describe their motion.</p>
<p>In kinematics we study the motion of idealized bodies. The first
concept of such a body is a particle.</p>
<p>See equation <a href="#mjx-eqn:eq:deltax">(1.1)</a></p>

Point-like particle</h2>

<p>A <strong>particle</strong> or <strong>point-like particle</strong>
is a fundamental concept in physics.</p>
<p>Imagine an airplane. Up close, you see its vastness and complexity.
Yet, when it’s soaring above, it looks like a tiny dot gliding smoothly
across the sky. If it travels 100 kilometers, we don’t distinguish which
specific part covers that distance. For our calculations, it’s just a
point in motion.</p>
<p>Alternatively, think of a Point-like particle as a tiny dot we draw
on a large object, like marking a dot on an airplane. Now, we focus on
tracking this dot’s movement rather than the entire airplane’s.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>
A <strong>Point-like particle</strong> is an object that is small enough
relative to the distance it travels.
</p>
</div>
<p>In physics, such simplifications are often resorted to. There are two
reasons for this. First, otherwise we will never solve any problem. The
world around us is much more complex than the mathematical models we try
to put it into. And secondly, the accuracy of the answers we get this
way is quite sufficient to solve the problems.</p>
<p>Now you know that if we see the words <strong>Point-like
particle</strong> in a problem, we imagine something small, the size,
shape and composition of which we are not interested in.</p>

Trajectory and Total Distance</h2>
<p>Imagine an airplane circling overhead, following a winding path while
leaving a trail from its engines. This path is its
<strong>Trajectory</strong>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>
A <strong>Trajectory</strong> is the path that a moving object follows.
</p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>Total distance</strong> or <strong>Distance
Traveled</strong> represents the entire length of the airplane’s
trajectory. It counts all its twists, turns, loops, and straight paths,
regardless of where it started or ended. Even if the plane returns close
to its starting point, the total distance covers its whole journey.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>
<strong>Total distance</strong> or <strong>Distance Traveled</strong> is
the length of the trajectory.

<section id="frame-of-reference" class="level2" data-number="1.3">
<h2 data-number="1.3"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span>
Frame of reference</h2>
<p>To describe an object’s position in space, we use a <strong>Frame of
Reference</strong>, defined by three elements: the
<strong>Origin</strong>, <strong>Orientation</strong>, and
<strong>Scale</strong>.</p>
<p>Imagine a unique road with regular milestones. Some milestones have
positive numbers, and others have negative ones. The starting point, or
zero, is the <strong>Origin</strong>. The direction in which the
milestones are numbered represents the <strong>Orientation</strong>. The
distance between milestones (like in kilometers or miles) is the
<strong>Scale</strong>. This road is similar to a
<strong>one-dimensional axis</strong> in Math, and with its milestones,
it serves as our <strong>Coordinate System</strong>, providing a
consistent way to pinpoint an object’s position.</p>
<p>This brings me to one of my favorite things in physics: you can
choose ANY point as your origin and ANY direction for orientation. Why?
Because these axes are merely mathematical representations of reality.
And math? It’s flexible; it doesn’t care about real-world details.
However, picking a reference point is crucial.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond the <strong>Frame of Reference</strong> is the
<strong>Observational Frame of Reference</strong>. While the former sets
our mathematical stage for motion, the latter is about our viewpoint of
the motion. It’s like the difference between setting a play’s stage and
choosing your theater seat. We’ll discuss more on observational frames
and their types later when we’ll be talking about inertial and
non-inertial frames.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.4"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span>
Position</h2>
<p>On our mathematical stage, the <strong>position</strong> of a point
is a crucial concept. In our road analogy, it’s like pinpointing exactly
which milestone a car is next to. In the world of math and physics, if
we’re using the x-axis to represent our frame of reference, the position
of the object is simply denoted by “x.” Whether it’s a car on a road or
any object, “x” gives us its exact location along that chosen axis. It’s
our marker, telling us where something is at any given moment.</p>
</section>
<section id="displacement" class="level2" data-number="1.5">
<h2 data-number="1.5"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span>
Displacement</h2>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Displacement</strong> refers to the change in position and is
denoted as: <span class="math display">\[
\Delta x = x - x_0 \tag{1.1} \label{eq:deltax}
\]</span> where, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the final
position, and <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> is the initial
position.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Total Distance</strong> vs. <strong>Displacement</strong>:
Total distance shows how much an object traveled, whereas displacement
indicates the net position change. For example, a car driving 5
kilometers north and then 5 kilometers south has a total distance of 10
kilometers, but a displacement of 0, as it returns to its starting
point.</p>

Vector and Scalar quantities</h2>
<p>In physics, we deal with many quantities like velocity, mass,
acceleration, and temperature. These fall into two categories: vector
and scalar. It’s vital to differentiate between them and handle them
correctly. Scalar quantities are represented by just a number and its
unit. Examples include mass, total distance, and temperature. You can
work with them just like regular numbers, using basic arithmetic
operations you learned in algebra. Vector quantities, unlike scalars,
have a direction in addition to their numerical value (magnitude).
Position, which we discussed earlier, is actually an example of a vector
quantity. While a scalar value of Total Distance would simply tell us “5
kilometers,” a Position would specify “5 kilometers North.”</p>

Unit vectors</h2>
<p>Unit vectors in 3D space address the issue of representing a vector
only by its magnitude, like r⃗=5m. This lacks the vector’s directional
information.</p>

<p>To know <strong>Physics</strong> is to know its language. To be able

if your speech or text resonates in people’s hearts, it means that you
