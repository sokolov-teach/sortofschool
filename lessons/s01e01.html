<p>How can we tell if someone truly understands Physics? Let’s answer
this question with another. How do we determine that a person knows a
language? It is easy; if a person can maintain a dialogue — written or
verbal — and at the same time we understand him, and he understands us,
it means that we speak the same language.</p>
<p>To know Physics is to know its language, to be able to make words out
of letters and meaningful sentences out of words. And if your speech or
text resonates in people’s hearts, it means that you have mastered this
language.</p>
<p>We start learning any language with its basic part — letters. In
order for you to understand what I will be talking about in future
lectures, we need to learn the basic concepts of Physics.</p>
<p>The first part of this series will be about
<strong>Kinematics</strong>. Kinematics is derived from the Greek word
for <em>“to move”</em>. Kinematics is a branch of Physics. It is not
interested in <strong>WHY</strong> bodies move and <strong>WHAT</strong>
sets them in motion. This section of physics only studies
<strong>HOW</strong> they move and the ways that we can describe their
motion.</p>
<p>In kinematics we study the motion of idealized bodies. The first
concept of such a body is a <strong>particle</strong>.</p>

Point-like particle</h2>
<p>A <strong>particle</strong> or <strong>point-like particle</strong>
is a fundamental concept in physics.</p>
<p>Imagine an airplane. Up close, this is a very complex object. Yet,
when it’s flying high above, it looks like a tiny dot. If it travels 100
kilometers, we don’t distinguish which specific part of the airplane
covers that distance. For our calculations, it just does not matter.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can think of a point-like particle as a tiny dot we
draw on a large object with a marker and we track this dot’s movement
instead of the entire airplane.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>
A <strong>Point-like particle</strong> is an object that is small enough
relative to the distance it travels.
</p>
</div>
<p>In physics, such simplifications are often resorted to. The reason is
that, otherwise, we would never solve any problem. The world around us
is much more complex than the mathematical models into which we try to
put it. Despite this fact, the accuracy of the answers we get by
simplifying the world in this way is quite sufficient to solve the
problems we encounter.</p>
<p>Now you know that if we see the words <strong>“point-like
particle”</strong> in a problem, we imagine something small, the size,
shape, and composition of which we are not interested.</p>

<h2 data-number="1.2"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span>
Trajectory and Total Distance</h2>
<p>Imagine an airplane circling high above, leaving a trail from its
engines. This trail reveals the <strong>trajectory</strong> of a
plane.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>
A <strong>trajectory</strong> is the path that a moving object follows.
</p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>total distance</strong> or <strong>distance
traveled</strong> represents the entire length of this trajectory. Its
value includes the lengths of all its curves and straight sections of
the plane’s journey.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>
<strong>Total distance</strong> or <strong>distance traveled</strong> is
the length of the trajectory.<br> We will denote it as <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.

<section id="frame-of-reference" class="level2" data-number="1.3">
<h2 data-number="1.3"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span>
Frame of reference</h2>
<p>A <strong>frame of reference</strong> is used to describe the
position of an object in space. It is defined by three main elements:
the <strong>origin</strong>, <strong>orientation</strong>, and
<strong>scale</strong>.</p>
<p>Imagine a road with milestones. The zero milestone represents the
<strong>origin</strong>. In one direction from the origin lie milestones
that are numbered negatively. In the other direction, they are numbered
positively; this direction is our <strong>orientation</strong>. The
distance between the milestones (it can be measured in kilometers,
miles, etc.), is the <strong>scale</strong>. Together these three
elements represent our <strong>frame of reference</strong>.</p>
<p>The concept of <strong>frame of reference</strong> is similar to a
<strong>one-dimensional axis</strong> in math. It serves the purpose of
a <strong>coordinate system</strong> and provides a way to describe an
object’s position.</p>
<p>This brings me to one of my favorite things in physics: you can
choose <strong>ANY</strong> point as your origin, <strong>ANY</strong>
direction for orientation and <strong>ANY</strong> scale. Why? Because
these axes are just mathematical representations of reality. They help
us to describe the movement of objects, but do not influence it. Some
frames of reference make solving the problem easier, but if we are not
concerned with the complexity of calculations, the final result will be
exactly the same, no matter what frame of reference we choose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apart from the term <strong>frame of reference</strong>, we also have
the <strong>observational frame of reference</strong>. They are a little
bit different. The first one sets the mathematical stage for describing
the motion, and the second one sets the viewpoint from which we observe
the motion. We will discuss observational frames later when we talk
about inertial and non-inertial frames.</p>

Position</h2>
<p>Using the road analogy we described earlier, the
<strong>position</strong> of the object is a milestone number that our
car is next to. If we use the <strong>x-axis</strong> to represent our
<strong>frame of reference</strong>, the position of a car is denoted
with the variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="displacement" class="level2" data-number="1.5">
<h2 data-number="1.5"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span>
Displacement</h2>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Displacement</strong> refers to the change in position and is
denoted as: <span class="math display">\[
\Delta x = x - x_0
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> represents the
current position, and <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> the
initial position.</p>
</div>
<p>Positive displacement means movement in the positive direction of our
axis, while negative displacement signifies movement in the opposite
direction.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Delta (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>):</strong>
This triangle symbol literally means <em>“change in”</em>. </br> So,
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span> signifies the change in
position. This symbol can be used to describe the change in any value.
For example, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta m\)</span> is a change
of mass, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span> represents a
change in time, etc.</p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>magnitude of displacement</strong> is the
<strong>absolute value</strong> of displacement and is denoted as <span
class="math inline">\(|\Delta x|\)</span>. It shows how much the object
has moved without concern for direction.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Total Distance</strong> vs. <strong>Displacement</strong>
vs. <strong>Magnitude of Displacement</strong> <br> Let’s say that the
car moved 7 kilometers in the positive direction of the x-axis and then
10 kilometers in the opposite direction. In this case, total distance,
displacement and its magnitude will be equal to: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{cases}
d = 17 km \\
\Delta x = -3 km \\
|\Delta x| = 3 km \\

Vector and Scalar quantities</h2>
<p>There are a lot of different quantities that are used in physics. All
of them fall in one of two brackets: either <strong>scalar</strong> or
<strong>vector</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Scalar</strong> quantities are represented only by their
values. You can perform standard arithmetic operations with them, as you
would in algebra. Some examples of such values are mass, temperature,
time.</p>
<p><strong>Vector</strong> quantities, unlike scalars, in addition to
their numerical value, have a direction. Examples of such values are
velocity, acceleration, force, and many more.</p>
<p>When working with such values we need to remember that they have a
direction, and subsequently, familiar mathematical operations such as
addition, subtraction, multiplication, need to be changed or redefined
to take direction of these values into account.</p>
</section>
<section id="position-vector" class="level2" data-number="2.2">
<h2 data-number="2.2"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span>
Position vector</h2>
<p>Let’s learn the language of vectors using a <strong>position
vector</strong> as an example. The <strong>position</strong> that we’ve
talked about previously, is actually a vector quantity. It is often
necessary to specify not only how far from the origin point the object
is located, but also in which direction.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>The <strong>position vector</strong>, or <strong>radius
vector</strong>, represents the direction and distance of a point
relative to the origin of the frame of reference. It is denoted as <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{r}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>In physics it is important to differentiate between vector and scalar
quantities, that’s why they are denoted differently. The main ways to
denote a vector are to use the dash or arrow above the symbol that
represents a vector. Some books or articles prefer to use bold text
instead. <span class="math display">\[\bar{r}, \vec{r},
\textbf{r}\]</span> I prefer to use dashes, because it is quicker to
draw by hand than the arrows, and bold text is not bold enough by my
liking in most of the fonts, to really differentiate it on a first
glance.</p>
<p>In diagrams vector quantities are drawn as arrows, where the
direction of an arrow shows direction of the quantity, and its length is
proportional to magnitude of the vector, i.e. the longer the arrow, the
larger the absolute value of this vector quantity.</p>
<p>The size or the <strong>magnitude</strong> or the <strong>absolute
value</strong> of the vector is essentially its length. It is always
positive. In math we use two vertical dashes to represent modulus of
scalar value. With vector values it becomes very tedious to do so — we
need to draw 3 dashes — two vertical and one horizontal. So, instead we
ditch them all! If you see a vector quantity without any dashes, this
implies that you are seeing the magnitude of this vector.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\bar{r}\)</span> — position vector</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(|\bar{r}| \equiv r\)</span> — magnitude
of position vector</p>
<div class="note">
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> a vector isn’t just a number. It has
magnitude and direction. Its magnitude can be a number, but a vector is
more than that. <strong>So avoid writing:</strong> <span
class="math display">\[\bar{r} = 5 km\]</span></p>

Frame of Reference in 2D</h2>
<p>So far, we have discussed only movement along a straight line. The
implementation of vectors allows us to describe the position of a point
(and, consequently, its movement) in a <strong>2D plane</strong> using
the <strong>Cartesian</strong> (or <strong>rectangular</strong>)
<strong>coordinate system</strong>.</p>
<p>In this system, we expand our <strong>frame of reference</strong> by
adding a second axis, the <strong>y-axis</strong> (vertical),
perpendicular to the <strong>x-axis</strong> (horizontal). These two
axes intersect at the <strong>origin</strong> point of the <strong>frame
of reference</strong>.</p>
<p>Every point in this 2D plane can be described by a combination of two
values — x and y, where x is the distance from a point to the y-axis,
and y is the distance from a point to the x-axis.</p>
</section>
<section id="vector-components" class="level2" data-number="2.4">
<h2 data-number="2.4"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span>
Vector Components</h2>
<p>Now, let’s imagine a lamp that shines directly onto position vector
<span class="math inline">\(\bar{r}\)</span> and casts a shadow onto the
x-axis. The length of this shadow represents the
<strong>x-component</strong> of the position vector. We denote this as
<span class="math inline">\(r_x\)</span>, to show it’s the x-component
of the vector <span class="math inline">\(\bar{r}\)</span>.</p>
<div class="note">
<p>When we discussed <strong>position</strong> (<span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>) in Level 1, we were actually referring
to the <span class="math inline">\(r_x\)</span> component of the
position vector <span class="math inline">\(\bar{r}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>The direction of this shadow dictates its sign. If the shadow tip
looks in the same direction as an axis, then it is positive. If the
shadow and an axis look in different directions, then the component of
the vector is negative.</p>
<p>Casting the shadow of our vector onto the x-axis forms a right
triangle. This triangle has the position vector <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{r}\)</span> as its hypotenuse and its shadow
as one of its legs (or catheti).</p>
<p>Using trigonometry, we can find the length of this x-axis projection.
The length of the x component, rx, is equal to: <span
class="math display">\[r_x=r \cos(\alpha)\]</span> where r is the
magnitude of the position vector, and α is the angle between it and the
x-axis.</p>
<p><strong>Vector is aligned with the axis.</strong> In this case, the
angle between the vector and the axis is equal to zero. Consequently,
the cosine of this angle is equal to one, so the component of the vector
is equal to its magnitude. <span
class="math display">\[r_x=r\cos(0^\circ)=r\]</span> This conclusion
matches our visual image — the shadow has the same length as the vector
itself.</p>
<p><strong>Vector is perpendicular to the axis.</strong> This way, the
vector does not cast any shadow to the axis, so its component should be
equal to zero — the same way as the pole does not cast any shadow when
the sun is at its highest (at zenith/directly overhead). Let’s check if
this conclusion matches our equation. In this case vector and axis form
a right angle (90 degrees) <span
class="math display">\[r_x=r\cos(90^\circ)=0\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Vector direction is opposite to the axis.</strong> When the
vector is directed opposite to the axis, the length of the shadow is
equal to the magnitude of the vector, but its sign is negative. The
angle between them is equal to 180 degrees, so the cosine of the angle
is equal to the negative one. <span
class="math display">\[r_x=r\cos(180^\circ)=-r\]</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p>The <strong>x-component</strong> of the vector <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{r}\)</span> is denoted as <span
class="math inline">\(r_x\)</span>. It varies in the range of <span
class="math inline">\([-r;r]\)</span> and is equal to: <span
class="math display">\[r_x=r\cos(\alpha)\]</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the magnitude of vector <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{r}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the angle between the vector
and the axis.</p>
</div>
<p>In the similar fashion we can describe the y-component of the vector.
In this case we also should be looking at the angle between the vector
and the y-axis. The visual representation stays the same — we are
imagining the shadow that the vector casts to the y-axis. <span
class="math display">\[r_y=r\cos(\beta)\]</span></p>
<p>However, in most cases it is easier to describe both components of
the vector in relation to one angle (usually angle between vector and
the x-axis is taken). So, if we take into account the fact that angles
alpha and beta make the right angle: <span class="math display">\[ \beta
= 90^\circ-\alpha\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[r_y=r\cos(90^\circ-\alpha)\]</span> And using
conversion formula we get: <span
class="math display">\[r_y=r\sin(\alpha)\]</span></p>
<div class="note">
<p>It is important to note that there is no inherent connection between
x-axis and cosine and y-axis and sine. The only reason why we got these
equations was the way we chose our axis and angles through which we
express components. If we decide to choose angle beta as our main angle
(or swap x-axis and y-axis), we will get: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{cases}
r_x=r\sin(\alpha) \\
r_y=r\cos(\alpha)
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Positions of x and y axes (as horizontal and vertical) and angles
that we choose are merely conventions and standard practices. We can
(and would in the future) change them, if we see it convenient.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Regardless of the specific axis or orientation, <strong>any</strong>
component of <strong>any</strong> vector can be expressed as the
magnitude of that vector multiplied by the cosine of the angle it makes
with the axis. <span
class="math display">\[\text{component}=|\text{vector}| \cdot
\cos(\theta)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>
is the angle between the vector and the chosen axis. And its
perpendicular component is expressed by: <span
class="math display">\[\text{component}_\bot=|\text{vector}| \cdot
\sin(\theta)\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Resolving a vector</strong> is the process of calculating all
of its components. This helps to see the vector’s influence in the
directions of our axes. <span class="math display">\[
\begin{cases}
r_x=r\cos(\alpha) \\
r_y=r\sin(\alpha)
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>If we know both components of the vector we can find its
<strong>magnitude</strong> by using the Pythagorean theorem, because the
components of the vector form a catheti of right angle triangle with the
vector itself representing its hypotenuse. <span
class="math display">\[r^2 = r_x^2+r_y^2\]</span></p>
<p>The trigonometric formulas that apply to a right triangle also can be
applied for a vector and its components.</p>

Addition of vectors</h2>
<p>We are familiar with operations such as addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division in algebra. However, for vectors, these
operations need to be redefined. This is because a vector has two
things: its magnitude and direction.</p>
<p>What do we get when we add two vectors? A new vector? What is the
magnitude and direction of this new vector? Similar questions could be
asked about the subtraction, multiplication, and division of two
vectors. In this lesson, we address only addition and subtraction and
will discuss multiplication later in this course.</p>
<p>When we add two vectors, we get a vector called the <strong>vector
sum</strong> (also known as the <strong>resultant</strong> or the
<strong>net</strong> of two vectors). <span
class="math display">\[\bar{c}=\bar{a}+\bar{b}\]</span></p>
<p>To determine the <strong>resultant</strong> graphically, we can use
the <strong>parallelogram method</strong>.</p>
<p>To use this method we place both vectors in such a way, so their
starting point is the same. Then, we draw two lines, parallel to each
vector, so they form a parallelogram. Then, we draw two lines parallel
to each vector, forming a parallelogram.</p>
<p>Another way to find the <strong>net</strong> of two vectors is to use
the <strong>tail-to-tip</strong> method. With this approach, we draw two
vectors such that the endpoint of the first vector coincides with the
starting point of the second vector. The sum vector begins at the
starting point of the first vector and ends at the endpoint of the
second vector.</p>
<p>This method is useful when performing the addition of multiple
vectors. We place them one by one consecutively. The resultant will be
drawn from the starting point of the first vector and end at the
endpoint of the last vector. <span
class="math display">\[\bar{d}=\bar{a}+\bar{b}+\bar{c}\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s look at some specific cases. Let’s take two vectors with
magnitudes of 4 and 3 for experimentation.</p>
<p>If these two vectors point in the same direction, the magnitude of
the resultant vector will be equal to the sum of their magnitudes, which
is 7. <span class="math display">\[\bar{c}=\bar{a}+\bar{b}\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[c=a+b=4+3=7\]</span></p>
<p>If these two vectors point in opposite directions, the magnitude of
their sum will be equal to the absolute value of the difference between
their magnitudes. <span
class="math display">\[\bar{c}=\bar{a}+\bar{b}\]</span> <span
class="math display">\[c=|a+b|=|4-3|=1\]</span></p>
<p class="takeaway">
This is still a vector addition process, even though we subtract their
magnitudes!
</p>
<p>When two vectors are perpendicular to each other, they form a right
triangle, with the vectors as the legs of this triangle. Therefore, the
magnitude of the resultant vector, which is the hypotenuse, can be found
using the Pythagorean theorem. <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
&amp;\bar{c}=\bar{a}+\bar{b} \\
&amp;c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\
&amp;c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>When two vectors are at some angle to each other (denoted as <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>), neither parallel nor
perpendicular, they form a triangle. The magnitude of their resultant
can be determined using the Law of Cosines, which I like to think of as
an extended form of the Pythagorean theorem. <span
class="math display">\[
\begin{matrix}
\bar{c}=\bar{a}+\bar{b} \\
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 -2ab\cos{(180^\circ - \alpha)} \\
\end{matrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>Using the trigonometric identity <span
class="math inline">\(cos(180^\circ-\alpha)=-cos(\alpha)\)</span>, this
becomes: <span class="math display">\[c^2 = a^2 + b^2
+2ab\cos{(\alpha)}\]</span></p>
<p>If we want to find an angle between two vectors, we can solve this
equation with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>:
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{matrix}
\cos(\alpha)=\frac{c^2-a^2-b^2}{2ab} \\
\alpha=\arccos{(\frac{c^2-a^2-b^2}{2ab})}
\end{matrix}
\]</span></p>
<div class="note">
<p>Even if it seems like we perform different operations based on vector
orientation, at its core, we are still dealing with vector addition.</p>
</div>
<p>When adding vectors using their components, think of combining the
shadows they cast on the x and y axes. Let’s demonstrate this with two
vectors, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{a}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{b}\)</span>, to find their resultant <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{c}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar{c}=\bar{a}+\bar{b}\]</span></p>
<p>First, we resolve vectors <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{a}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{b}\)</span>. If <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{a}\)</span> makes an angle <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> with the x-axis, its components
are:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
a_x&amp;=a\cos(\alpha) \\
a_y&amp;=a\sin(\alpha)
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>For vector <span class="math inline">\(\bar{b}\)</span>, which forms
an angle <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> with the x-axis it
resolves like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
b_x&amp;=b\cos(\alpha) \\
b_y&amp;=b\sin(\alpha)
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>To get the x and y components of the resultant vector <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{c}\)</span>, we add their respective
components together: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
c_x&amp;=a_x+b_x \\
c_y&amp;=a_y+b_y
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>Finally, to determine the magnitude and direction of the resultant
vector c, we use the following equations: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
c &amp;= \sqrt{c_x^2+c_y^2} \\
\theta &amp;= \arctan(\frac{c_y}{c_x})
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>

Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar</h2>
<p>Imagine a vector <span class="math inline">\(\bar{a}\)</span>. When
we multiply it by a scalar, say 2, the result is a new vector <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{c}\)</span>. Let’s explore what this means
for the magnitude and direction of <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{c}\)</span>. <span
class="math display">\[\bar{c}=2\cdot\bar{a}\]</span></p>
<p>The magnitude of c will be double that of a. Thus, c will have twice
the length of a: <span class="math display">\[c=2\cdot a\]</span></p>
<p>Moreover, the new vector will point in the same direction as a
starting vector <span class="math inline">\(\bar{a}\)</span>. But if we
multiply <span class="math inline">\(\bar{a}\)</span> by a negative
value, like <span class="math inline">\(-2\)</span>, the resulting
vector will have the same magnitude but will point in the opposite
direction. <span class="math display">\[
\begin{matrix}
\bar{c} = -2\cdot \bar{a} \\
c = 2 \cdot a
\end{matrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>To summarize, scalar multiplication changes the length of a vector.
If the scalar is negative, the direction of the vector reverses.</p>
<p>Specifically, if <span class="math inline">\(\bar{a}\)</span> is
multiplied by <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>, the result is
<span class="math inline">\(-\bar{a}\)</span>, known as the negative
vector. This new vector has the same magnitude but points in the reverse
direction.</p>

<h2 data-number="2.7"><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span>
Vector Subtraction</h2>
<p>To subtract two vectors, we can use the same rules as we did for
addition, with a slight twist. Essentially, subtracting vector <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{b}\)</span> from vector <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{a}\)</span> is the same thing as adding
vectors <span class="math inline">\(\bar{a}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(-\bar{b}\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[
\begin{matrix}
\bar{c} = \bar{a}-\bar{b} \\
\bar{c} = \bar{a}+(-\bar{b})
\end{matrix}
\]</span></p>
<p>Visually, this is equivalent to joining the starting point of the
vector <span class="math inline">\(-\bar{b}\)</span> to the end point of
vector <span class="math inline">\(\bar{a}\)</span>. If you want to
approach this task using their individual components, vector <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{c}\)</span> can be constructed by subtracting
the components of vector <span class="math inline">\(\bar{a}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(\bar{b}\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
c_x&amp;=a_x-b_x \\
c_y&amp;=a_y-b_y

Displacement vector</h2>
<p>With our knowledge of vectors, we can redefine the
<strong>displacement vector</strong> in a 2D plane. The displacement
vector <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\bar{r}\)</span> is the
difference between the final position vector <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{r}\)</span> and the initial position vector
<span class="math inline">\(\overline{r_0}\)</span>. <span
class="math display">\[\Delta\bar{r} =
\bar{r}-\overline{r_0}\]</span></p>
<div class="note">
<p>Our earlier discussion on <strong>displacement</strong> (<span
class="math inline">\(\Delta x\)</span>) in Level 1 was actually about
the x-component of the <strong>displacement vector</strong>. <span
class="math display">\[\Delta x = \Delta r_x\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>Another way to understand displacement is through vector addition. By
adding the <strong>initial position vector</strong> and
<strong>displacement vector</strong>, we get the <strong>final position
vector</strong>: <span class="math display">\[\overline{r_0} +
\Delta\bar{r} = \bar{r}\]</span></p>

Unit vectors</h2>
<p>Unit vectors address the issue of representing a vector solely by its
magnitude, as shown here: <span class="math display">\[\bar{r} =
5\]</span></p>
<p>This kind of notation is incorrect because it lacks the vector’s
directional information.</p>
<p>A <strong>unit vector</strong> helps to solve this problem. A unit
vector is unitless, has a magnitude of 1, and indicates only direction.
In a 3D Cartesian system, the three main unit vectors are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\hat{i}\)</span> — points in the
direction of the x-axis.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\hat{j}\)</span> — points in the
direction of the y-axis.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\hat{k}\)</span> — points in the
direction of the z-axis.</li>
</ol>
<p>These three vectors form the <strong>basis</strong> for the system.
Any vector <span class="math inline">\(\bar{r}\)</span> in this system
can be expressed as a linear combination of them: <span
class="math display">\[\bar{r}=r_x\hat{i}+r_y\hat{j}+r_z\hat{k}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(r_x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(r_y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r_z\)</span> are the components of the vector
<span class="math inline">\(\bar{r}\)</span> in the x, y, and z axes,
respectively.</p>
<p>The unit vectors <span class="math inline">\(\hat{i}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{j}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{k}\)</span> define the system’s orientation.
In a right-handed system, curling your fingers from <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{i}\)</span> (x-axis) to <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{j}\)</span> (y-axis) makes your thumb point
towards <span class="math inline">\(\hat{k}\)</span> (z-axis).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is also a left-handed system, but the right-handed one is more
common in physics. Maintaining the right orientation is vital,
especially for the operation of vector multiplication that we will
discuss in a future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The beauty of unit vector notation lies in its ability to simplify
vector operations. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>For addition:</strong> <span
class="math display">\[\bar{a}+\bar{b}=(a_x+b_x)\hat{i}+(a_y+b_y)\hat{j}+(a_z+b_z)\hat{k}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>For subtraction:</strong> <span
class="math display">\[\bar{a}-\bar{b}=(a_x-b_x)\hat{i}+(a_y-b_y)\hat{j}+(a_z-b_z)\hat{k}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>For multiplication by a scalar:</strong> <span
class="math display">\[C\cdot\bar{a}=C a_x \hat{i}+C a_y \hat{j}+C a_z
\hat{k}\]</span></p>

Plane Polar Coordinates</h2>
<p>Cartesian coordinates <span class="math inline">\((r_x,r_y)\)</span>
describe a point in a plane by its horizontal and vertical positions. In
contrast, <strong>plane polar coordinates</strong> <span
class="math inline">\((r,\alpha)\)</span> represent the same point by
its distance <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> from the origin and
the angle <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> it forms with the
positive x-axis.</p>
<p>Converting between the two coordinate systems:</p>
<p>From Cartesian to Polar: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
r &amp;= \sqrt{r_x^2+r_y^2} \\
\alpha &amp;= \arctan(\frac{r_y}{r_x})

Vector Representation with its Directional Unit Vector</h2>
<p>When describing vectors, especially in polar coordinate systems, it
is beneficial to express them in terms of their magnitude and direction.
The direction is typically represented by a <strong>directional unit
vector</strong>, which has a magnitude of 1 and points in the specified
direction.</p>
<p>For instance, the positional vector <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{r}\)</span> can be expressed as: <span
class="math display">\[\bar{r} = r \overline{e_r}\]</span> Here, <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the magnitude of the positional
vector we’re describing, and <span
class="math inline">\(\overline{e_r}\)</span> is its unit vector,
pointing in the direction of <span
class="math inline">\(\bar{r}\)</span></p>
<p>Similarly, a displacement vector <span class="math inline">\(\Delta
\bar{r}\)</span> can be represented as: <span
class="math display">\[\Delta \bar{r} = |\Delta \bar{r}| \cdot
\overline{e_{\Delta r}}\]</span></p>
<p>It’s essential to note a distinction here: unlike in our earlier
discussions where the magnitude of a vector was represented without
vertical bars, they are crucial in this context. The bars around <span
class="math inline">\(|\Delta \bar{r}|\)</span> emphasize
<strong>magnitude of change in position</strong>, while <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta r\)</span> indicates the <strong>change in
magnitude of position</strong>, which does not consider direction of a
vector.</p>
<p>To understand this difference:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If there is only a change in the direction of position, the
displacement magnitude is non-zero, i.e., <span
class="math inline">\(|\Delta \bar{r}|&gt;0\)</span>, but the change in
magnitude is zero, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta r =
0\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If the change is solely in the magnitude of position, both values
are the same: <span class="math inline">\(|\Delta \bar{r}| = \Delta
r\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
