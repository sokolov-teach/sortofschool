How can we tell if someone truly understands Physics?
Let's answer this question with another. How do we determine that a person knows a language? It is easy; if a person can maintain a dialogue — written or verbal — and at the same time we understand him, and he understands us, it means that we speak the same language.

To know Physics is to know its language, to be able to make words out of letters and meaningful sentences out of words. And if your speech or text resonates in people's hearts, it means that you have mastered this language.

We start learning any language with its basic part — letters. In order for you to understand what I will be talking about in future lectures, we need to learn the basic concepts of Physics.

The first part of this series will be about **Kinematics**. Kinematics is derived from the Greek word for *"to move"*. Kinematics is a branch of Physics. It is not interested in WHY bodies move and WHAT sets them in motion. This section of physics only studies HOW they move and the ways that we can describe their motion.  

In kinematics we study the motion of idealized bodies. The first concept of such a body is a **particle**. 

# Elementary

## Point-like particle

A **particle** or **point-like particle** is a fundamental concept in physics.

Imagine an airplane. Up close, this is a very complex object. Yet, when it's flying high above, it looks like a tiny dot. If it travels 100 kilometers, we don't distinguish which specific part of the airplane covers that distance. For our calculations, it just does not matter.

Alternatively, we can think of a point-like particle as a tiny dot we draw on a large object with a marker and we track this dot's movement instead of the entire airplane.

<div class="definition">
<p>A **Point-like particle** is an object that is small enough relative to the distance it travels.</p>
</div>

In physics, such simplifications are often resorted to. The reason is that, otherwise, we would never solve any problem. The world around us is much more complex than the mathematical models into which we try to put it. Despite this fact, the accuracy of the answers we get by simplifying the world in this way is quite sufficient to solve the problems we encounter.

Now you know that if we see the words **"point-like particle"** in a problem, we imagine something small, the size, shape, and composition of which we are not interested.

## Trajectory and Total Distance

Imagine an airplane circling high above, leaving a trail from its engines. This trail reveals the **trajectory** of a plane. 

<div class="definition">
<p>A **trajectory** is the path that a moving object follows.</p>
</div>

The **total distance** or **distance traveled** represents the entire length of this trajectory. Its value includes the lengths of all its curves and straight sections of the plane’s journey. 

<div class="definition">
<p>**Total distance** or **distance traveled** is the length of the trajectory.<br>
We will denote it as $d$.</p>
</div>

## Frame of reference

A **frame of reference** is used to describe the position of an object in space. It is defined by three main elements: the **origin**, **orientation**, and **scale**.

Imagine a road with milestones. The zero milestone represents the **origin**. In one direction from the origin lie milestones that are numbered negatively. In the other direction, they are numbered positively; this direction is our **orientation**. The distance between the milestones (it can be measured in kilometers, miles, etc.), is the **scale**. Together these three elements represent our **frame of reference**.

The concept of **frame of reference** is similar to a **one-dimensional axis** in math. It serves the purpose of a **coordinate system** and provides a way to describe an object's position.

This brings me to one of my favorite things in physics: you can choose ANY point as your origin, ANY direction for orientation and ANY scale. Why? Because these axes are just mathematical representations of reality. They help us to describe the movement of objects, but do not influence it. Some frames of reference make solving the problem easier, but if we are not concerned with the complexity of calculations, the final result will be exactly the same, no matter what frame of reference we choose.

>Apart from the term **frame of reference**, we also have the **observational frame of reference**.  They are a little bit different. The first one sets the mathematical stage for describing the motion, and the second one sets the viewpoint from which we observe the motion. We'll discuss observational frames later when we talk about inertial and non-inertial frames.

## Position
Using the road analogy we described earlier, the **position** of the object is a milestone number that our car is next to. If we use the **x-axis** to represent our **frame of reference**, the position of a car is denoted with the variable $x$. 

## Displacement

<div class="definition">
**Displacement** refers to the change in position and is denoted as:
$$
\Delta x = x - x_0 \tag{1.1} \label{eq:deltax}
$$
where $x$ represents the current position, and $x_0$ the initial position.
</div>

Positive displacement means movement in the positive direction of our axis, while negative displacement signifies movement in the opposite direction.

<div class="definition">
**Delta ($\Delta$):** This triangle symbol literally means *"change in"*. </br>
So, $\Delta x$ signifies the change in position. This symbol can be used to describe the change in any value. For example, $\Delta m$ is a change of mass, $\Delta t$ represents a change in time, etc.
</div>

The **magnitude of displacement** is the absolute value of displacement and is denoted as $|\Delta x|$. It shows how much the object has moved without concern for direction.

<div class="note">
**Total Distance** vs. **Displacement** vs. **Magnitude of Displacement** <br>
Let’s say that the car moved 7 kilometers in the positive direction of the x-axis and then 10 kilometers in the opposite direction. In this case, total distance, displacement and it's magnitude will be equal to: 
$$\begin{cases}
d = 17 km \\
\Delta x = -3 km \\
|\Delta x| = 3 km \\
\end{cases}
$$
</div>

## Vector and Scalar quantities

There are a lot of different quantities that are used in physics. All of them fall in one of two brackets: either **scalar** or **vector**.

**Scalar** quantities are represented only by their values. You can perform standard arithmetic operations with them, as you would in algebra. Some examples of such values are mass, temperature, time. 

**Vector** quantities, unlike scalars, in addition to their numerical value, have a direction. Examples of such values are velocity, acceleration, force, and many more. 

When working with such values we need to remember that they have a direction, and subsequently, familiar mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, need to be changed or redefined to take direction of these values into account. 

## Position vector

Let's learn the language of vectors using a **position vector** as an example. The **position** that we’ve talked about previously, is actually a vector quantity. It is often necessary to specify not only how far from the origin point the object is located, but also in which direction.

<div class="definition">
The **position vector**, or **radius vector**, represents  the direction and distance of a point relative to the origin of the frame of reference. It is denoted as $\bar{r}$.
</div>

In physics it is important to differentiate between vector and scalar quantities, that's why they are denoted differently. The main ways to denote a vector are to use the dash or arrow above the symbol that represents a vector. Some books or articles prefer to use bold text instead. 
$$\bar{r}, \vec{r}, \textbf{r}$$
I prefer to use dashes, because it is quicker to draw by hand than the arrows, and bold text is not bold enough by my liking in most of the fonts, to really differentiate it on a first glance.

In diagrams vector quantities are drawn as arrows, where the direction of an arrow shows direction of the quantity, and its length is proportional to magnitude of the vector, i.e. the longer the arrow, the larger the absolute value of this vector quantity.

The size or the **magnitude** or the **absolute value** of the vector is essentially its length. It is always positive. In math we use two vertical dashes to represent modulus of scalar value. With vector values it becomes very tedious to do so — we need to draw 3 dashes — two vertical and one horizontal. So, instead we ditch them all! If you see a vector quantity without any dashes, this implies that you are seeing the magnitude of this vector.

$\bar{r}$  — position vector

$|\bar{r}| \equiv r$  — magnitude of position vector

<div class="note">
**Remember:** a vector isn't just a number. It has magnitude and direction. Its magnitude can be a number, but a vector is more than that. 
**So avoid writing:**
$$\bar{r} = 5 km$$
</div>

## Frame of Reference in 2D

So far, we have discussed only movement along a straight line. The implementation of vectors allows us to describe the position of a point (and, consequently, its movement) in a **2D plane** using the **Cartesian** (or **rectangular**) **coordinate system**.

In this system, we expand our **frame of reference** by adding a second axis, the **y-axis** (vertical), perpendicular to the **x-axis** (horizontal). These two axes intersect at the **origin** point of the **frame of reference**.

Every point in this 2D plane can be described by a combination of two values — x and y, where x is the distance from a point to the y-axis, and y is the distance from a point to the x-axis.

## Vector Components

Now, let’s imagine a lamp that shines directly onto position vector $\bar{r}$ and casts a shadow onto the x-axis. The length of this shadow represents the **x-component** of the position vector.
We denote this as $r_x$, to show it's the x-component of the vector $\bar{r}$.

<div class="note">
When we discussed **position** ($x$) in Level 1, we were actually referring to the $r_x$ component of the position vector $\bar{r}$. 
</div>

The direction of this shadow dictates its sign. If the shadow tip looks in the same direction as an axis, then it is positive. If the shadow and an axis look in different directions, then the component of the vector is negative.

Casting the shadow of our vector onto the x-axis forms a right triangle. This triangle has the position vector $\bar{r}$ as its hypotenuse and its shadow as one of its legs (or catheti).

Using trigonometry, we can find the length of this x-axis projection. The length of the x component, rx, is equal to:
$$r_x=r \cos(\alpha)$$ 
where r is the magnitude of the position vector, and α is the angle between it and the x-axis.

**Vector is aligned with the axis.**
In this case, the angle between the vector and the axis is equal to zero. Consequently, the cosine of this angle is equal to one, so the component of the vector is equal to its magnitude. 
$$r_x=r\cos(0^\circ)=r$$
This conclusion matches our visual image — the shadow has the same length as the vector itself.

**Vector is perpendicular to the axis.**
This way, the vector does not cast any shadow to the axis, so its component should be equal to zero — the same way as the pole does not cast any shadow  when the sun is at its highest (at zenith/directly overhead). Let’s check if this conclusion matches our equation. In this case vector and axis form a right angle (90 degrees)
$$r_x=r\cos(90^\circ)=0$$

**Vector direction is opposite to the axis.**
When the vector is directed opposite to the axis, the length of the shadow is equal to the magnitude of the vector, but its sign is negative. The angle between them is equal to 180 degrees, so the cosine of the angle is equal to the negative one.
$$r_x=r\cos(180^\circ)=-r$$

<div class="definition">
The **x-component** of the vector $\bar{r}$ is denoted as $r_x$.  It varies in the range of $[-r;r]$ and is equal to:
$$r_x=r\cos(\alpha)$$
where $r$ is the magnitude of vector $\bar{r}$, and $\alpha$ is the angle between the vector and the axis.
</div>

In the similar fashion we can describe the y-component of the vector. In this case we also should be looking at the angle  between the vector and the y-axis. The visual representation stays the same — we are imagining the shadow that the vector casts to the y-axis.
$$r_y=r\cos(\beta)$$

However, in most cases it is easier to describe both components of the vector in relation to one angle (usually angle between vector and the x-axis is taken). So, if we take into account the fact that angles alpha and beta make the right angle:
$$ \beta = 90^\circ-\alpha$$
$$r_y=r\cos(90^\circ-\alpha)$$
And using conversion formula we get:
$$r_y=r\sin(\alpha)$$

<div class="note">
It is important to note that there is no inherent connection between x-axis and cosine and y-axis and sine. The only reason why we got these equations was the way we chose our axis and angles through which we express components. If we decide to choose angle beta as our main angle (or swap x-axis and y-axis), we will get:
$$
\begin{cases}
r_x=r\sin(\alpha) \\
r_y=r\cos(\alpha)
\end{cases}
$$
</div>

Positions of x and y axes (as horizontal and vertical) and angles that we choose are merely conventions and standard practices. We can (and would in the future) change them, if we see it convenient. 

<div class="definition">
Regardless of the specific axis or orientation, **any** component of **any** vector can be expressed as the magnitude of that vector multiplied by the cosine of the angle it makes with the axis. 
$$\text{component}=|\text{vector}| \cdot \cos(\theta)$$
where $\alpha$ is the angle between the vector and the chosen axis.
And its perpendicular component is expressed by:
$$\text{component}_\bot=|\text{vector}| \cdot \sin(\theta)$$
</div>

<div class="definition">
**Resolving a vector** is the process of calculating all of its components. This helps to see the vector's influence in the directions of our axes.
$$
\begin{cases}
r_x=r\cos(\alpha) \\
r_y=r\sin(\alpha)
\end{cases}
$$
</div>

If we know both components of the vector we can find its **magnitude** by using the Pythagorean theorem, because the components of the vector form a catheti of right angle triangle with the vector itself representing its hypotenuse.
$$r^2 = r_x^2+r_y^2$$

The trigonometric formulas that apply to a right triangle also can be applied for a vector and its components.

|Function							|Angle (Inverce function)				|
|--------------						|-----------							|
| $$\cos(\alpha) = \frac{r_x}{r}$$ 	| $$\alpha = \arccos{\frac{r_x}{r}}$$ 	|
| $$\sin(\alpha) = \frac{r_y}{r}$$ 	| $$\alpha = \arcsin{\frac{r_y}{r}}$$ 	|
| $$\tan(\alpha) = \frac{r_y}{r_x}$$| $$\alpha = \arctan{\frac{r_y}{r_x}}$$ |
