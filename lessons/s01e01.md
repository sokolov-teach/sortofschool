How can we tell if someone truly understands Physics?
Let's answer this question with another. How do we determine that a person knows a language? It is easy; if a person can maintain a dialogue — written or verbal — and at the same time we understand him, and he understands us, it means that we speak the same language.

To know Physics is to know its language, to be able to make words out of letters and meaningful sentences out of words. And if your speech or text resonates in people's hearts, it means that you have mastered this language.

We start learning any language with its basic part — letters. In order for you to understand what I will be talking about in future lectures, we need to learn the basic concepts of Physics.

The first Part of this series will be about **Kinematics**. Kinematics is derived from the Greek word for *"to move"*. Kinematics is a branch of Physics. It is not interested in WHY bodies move and WHAT sets them in motion. This section of physics only studies HOW they move and the ways that we can describe their motion.  

In kinematics we study the motion of idealized bodies. The first concept of such a body is a **particle**. 

# Elementary

## Point-like particle

A **particle** or **point-like particle** is a fundamental concept in physics.

Imagine an airplane. Up close, this is a very complex object. Yet, when it's flying high above, it looks like a tiny dot. If it travels 100 kilometers, we don't distinguish which specific part of the airplane covers that distance. For our calculations, it just does not matter.

Alternatively, we can think of a point-like particle as a tiny dot we draw on a large object with a marker and we track this dot's movement instead of the entire airplane.

<div class="definition">
<p>A **Point-like particle** is an object that is small enough relative to the distance it travels.</p>
</div>

In physics, such simplifications are often resorted to. The reason is that, otherwise, we would never solve any problem. The world around us is much more complex than the mathematical models into which we try to put it. Despite this fact, the accuracy of the answers we get by simplifying the world in this way is quite sufficient to solve the problems we encounter.

Now you know that if we see the words **"point-like particle"** in a problem, we imagine something small, the size, shape, and composition of which we are not interested.

## Trajectory and Total Distance

Imagine an airplane circling high above, leaving a trail from its engines. This trail reveals the **trajectory** of a plane. 

<div class="definition">
<p>A **trajectory** is the path that a moving object follows.</p>
</div>

The **total distance** or **distance traveled** represents the entire length of this trajectory. Its value includes the lengths of all its curves and straight sections of the plane’s journey. 

<div class="definition">
<p>**Total distance** or **distance traveled** is the length of the trajectory.<br>
We will denote it as $d$.</p>
</div>

## Frame of reference

A **frame of reference** is used to describe the position of an object in space. It is defined by three main elements: the **origin**, **orientation**, and **scale**.

Imagine a road with milestones. The zero milestone represents the **origin**. In one direction from the origin lie milestones that are numbered negatively. In the other direction, they are numbered positively; this direction is our **orientation**. The distance between the milestones (it can be measured in kilometers, miles, etc.), is the **scale**. Together these three elements represent our **frame of reference**.

The concept of **frame of reference** is similar to a **one-dimensional axis** in math. It serves the purpose of a **coordinate system** and provides a way to describe an object's position.

This brings me to one of my favorite things in physics: you can choose ANY point as your origin, ANY direction for orientation and ANY scale. Why? Because these axes are just mathematical representations of reality. They help us to describe the movement of objects, but do not influence it. Some frames of reference make solving the problem easier, but if we are not concerned with the complexity of calculations, the final result will be exactly the same, no matter what frame of reference we choose.

>Apart from the term **frame of reference**, we also have the **observational frame of reference**.  They are a little bit different. The first one sets the mathematical stage for describing the motion, and the second one sets the viewpoint from which we observe the motion. We'll discuss observational frames later when we talk about inertial and non-inertial frames.

## Position
Using the road analogy we described earlier, the **position** of the object is a milestone number that our car is next to. If we use the **x-axis** to represent our **frame of reference**, the position of a car is denoted with the variable $x$. 

## Displacement

<div class="definition">
**Displacement** refers to the change in position and is denoted as:
$$
\Delta x = x - x_0 \tag{1.1} \label{eq:deltax}
$$
where $x$ represents the current position, and $x_0$ the initial position.
</div>

Positive displacement means movement in the positive direction of our axis, while negative displacement signifies movement in the opposite direction.

<div class="definition">
**Delta ($\Delta$):** This triangle symbol literally means *"change in"*. </br>
So, $\Delta x$ signifies the change in position. This symbol can be used to describe the change in any value. For example, $\Delta m$ is a change of mass, $\Delta m$ represents a change in time, etc.
</div>

The **magnitude of displacement** is the absolute value of displacement and is denoted as $|\Delta x|$. It shows how much the object has moved without concern for direction.

<div class="note">
**Total Distance** vs. **Displacement** vs. **Magnitude of Displacement** <br>
Let’s say that the car moved 7 kilometers in the positive direction of the x-axis and then 10 kilometers in the opposite direction. In this case, total distance, displacement and it's magnitude will be equal to: 
$$\begin{cases}
d = 17 km \\
\Delta x = -3 km \\
|\Delta x| = 3 km \\
\end{cases}
$$
