### Backquotes

> [!SUCCESS]+ **SUCCESS!**
> The final velocity is 20 m/s.

> [!TIP]+ **TIP:** Always check your units when solving physics problems.
> For example, $1 \text{ km} = 1000 \text{ m}$.

> [!ABSTRACT] **ABSTRACT**:
> Newton's laws of motion provide the basis for classical mechanics.

> [!NOTE]+ **NOTE** have both magnitude and direction.
> For instance, velocity is a vector, whereas speed is scalar.

> [!INFO]+ **INFO** are crucial in physics.
> For example, distance is often measured in meters ($m$).

> [!TODO]+ **TODO** of the equation for free-fall motion.
> Hint: Use $s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$ where $u=0$.

> [!EXAMPLE]+ **EXAMPLE**: A ball is thrown with an initial velocity of $10 \, \text{m/s}$ at an angle of $45^\circ$.
> Find its range using $R = \frac{v^2 \sin 2\theta}{g}$.

> [!WARNING]+ **WARNING** or **distance traveled** is the length of the trajectory.
> We will denote it as $d$.

> [!QUESTION]+ **QUESTION**
> The acceleration due to gravity ($g$) is approximately $9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$ near the Earth's surface.

> [!FAILURE]+ **FAILURE**: Acceleration is not constant in non-uniform motion.
> Recalculate with $a = f(t)$.

> [!DANGER]+ **DANGER:** Exceeding the speed of light ($c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}$) violates relativity.
> Ensure your calculations respect physical laws.

> [!BUG]+ **BUG** Numerical instability in solving $x = \frac{1}{1 - e^{-t}}$ for large $t$.
> Consider approximations for $t \to \infty$.

> [!QUOTE]+ *"The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to one another."* â€“ Einstein
