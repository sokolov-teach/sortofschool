My name is Sviatoslav Sokolov. After getting my master's degree, I found a passion for teaching. First as a private tutor, then as a school teacher. 

Preparing materials for the lectures I often found that the experiments posted on YouTube were poorly filmed, not entirely accurate, or some important moments were missing. In addition, I got bored explaining the same lecture over and over again. So I started making animated videos for my students.

Right now, there are over 50 lectures produced, but with all the experience that I've gained creating them, I want to make them better, translate the material into English, and share it with other teachers.
